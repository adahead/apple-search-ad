/**
 * Selector Object
 *
 * You may use Selector objects to filter and limit the number of records returned. Selector objects are often used with the …/<object>/find and …/reporting methods.
 *
 * A Selector object consists of one or more of the following elements.
 *
 * conditions —
 *
 * A list of condition objects, which allows users to filter the list of records. This is analogous to the SQL WHERE clause.
 * Each condition object consists of the following elements:
 * field — the name of a field.
 * operator —
 * IN. Value is in the given list.
 * EQUALS. Value is as specified.
 * GREATER_THAN. Value is greater than the given value. May be used with time parameters.
 * LESS_THAN. Value is less than the given value. May be used with time parameters.
 * STARTSWITH. The STARTSWITH operator is used with the /reporting API only.
 * values — a list of matching values.
 * Multiple conditions are ANDed together.
 * fields —
 *
 * A list of field names to return within each record. For an example, refer to the Partial Fetch section
 * orderBy —
 *
 * Optionally specify the field to use to sort the records.
 * Optionally specify the sort order (ASCENDING or DESCENDING).
 * For most objects, the defaults are the sort field is the primary key in descending order.
 * pagination —
 *
 * You can use pagination to limit number of records returned. For details, refer to the Pagination section.
 * Here is an example of a Selector call.
 *
 * Example Selector Call
 * POST /v1/campaigns/find
 *
 * //request body (not to be included)
 *
 * {
 * "orderBy":[{"field":"id","sortOrder":"DESCENDING"}],
 * "fields":["id","name","modificationTime","budgetAmount"],
 * "conditions":[
 * {"field":"modificationTime","operator":"GREATER_THAN","values":["2016-09-21T0:0:0.00"]}
 * ],
 * "pagination":{"offset":0,"limit":10}
 * }
 * Class Selector
